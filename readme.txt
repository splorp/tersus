Tersus
======

An achingly simple WordPress theme without all the usual cruft.


About
-----

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

Why create yet another theme? Well, as clean and stripped down as some
themes are, we wanted to prune things a bit further.

Tersus was originally named Simplicity — a term that described exactly
what the project was all about. However, that was prior to the discovery
of a WordPress theme already using that very name. After a brief
discussion, several Latin terms were bandied about as replacements.
Tersus (which means ‘clean, neat, or cleansed’) seemed to fit the bill
rather nicely — and here we are.

A version of Tersus is being developed for Tumblr and is also available
on GitHub.

By removing the majority of the presentational markup and other cruft
